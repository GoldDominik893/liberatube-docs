My friends and I wanted to get past the filter and thats when it started, it was called \"Bad YouTube\", I made a working version in only one night where you could search YouTube using keywords and then use a YouTube video link to go to an external site and download it as an mp4. Then I stumbled upon Invidous, and had taken a look how it works, then I started to make \"Bad YouTube\" even better by supplying the video directly on the website, no need for downloads. I didn't indend for any harm using it, until it spread and many were using it, which would obviously raise alarm bells for the IT team and it did. Ever since then I stopped playing the game as it wasn't worth getting in trouble for. Now \"Bad YouTube\" is called Liberatube and serves the purpose as a better way to access YouTube without all the Ads and Spyware from Google.</p>"},{"location":"general/1.about/#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<p>In newer versions, Liberatube does not use any Google or YouTube API's, but uses the Invidious API to get all of the data from YouTube.</p>"},{"location":"general/2.instances/","title":"Instances","text":""},{"location":"general/2.instances/#list-of-verified-instances","title":"List of verified Instances","text":"URL Type Version MiTM Country Hosted By Source lt.epicsite.xyz Stable v1.8 Cloudflare United Kingdom GoldDominik893 Unmodified ltbeta.epicsite.xyz Beta Development Cloudflare United Kingdom GoldDominik893 Unmodified <p>UptimeRobot for all verified instances: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/80V8ECOQBz</p> <p>All instances on this list are considered trustworthy as they have been checked.</p> <p>We reserve the right to take an instance off this list if we believe there is a good reason to do so.</p>"},{"location":"general/2.instances/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>All instances must follow the following criteria to be listed:</p> <ul> <li>Served via a domain name</li> <li>Served over HTTPS</li> <li>Properly configured</li> <li>Uptime of at least 80%</li> <li>Is up to date with the latest version (allow 30 days upon release of a new version under releases tab on GitHub)</li> <li>A man in the middle such as Cloudflare needs to be stated</li> <li>If your source code is modified the URL must be stated</li> </ul> <p>If your instance matches the criteria, you can Open the New public instance proposal form.</p>"},{"location":"general/3.videos/","title":"Videos","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v18","title":"v1.8","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v17","title":"v1.7","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v16","title":"v1.6","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v16-prototype-2","title":"v1.6 Prototype 2","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v16-prototype-1","title":"v1.6 Prototype 1","text":""},{"location":"general/3.videos/#v15","title":"v1.5","text":""},{"location":"general/4.privacy/","title":"Privacy","text":"<p>Last updated: 2025-07-04 16:11</p>"},{"location":"general/4.privacy/#00-introduction","title":"0.0 Introduction","text":"<p>0.0.1 The developer of Liberatube believes, privacy in the modern world is slowly being eroded.
