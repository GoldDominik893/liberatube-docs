## History

Liberatube all started when YouTube got banned in my school. My friends and I wanted to get past the filter and thats when it started, it was called "Bad YouTube", I made a working version in only one night where you could search YouTube using keywords and then use a YouTube video link to go to an external site and download it as an mp4. Then I stumbled upon Invidous, and had taken a look how it works, then I started to make "Bad YouTube" even better by supplying the video directly on the website, no need for downloads. I didn't indend for any harm using it, until it spread and many were using it, which would obviously raise alarm bells for the IT team and it did. Ever since then I stopped playing the game as it wasn't worth getting in trouble for. Now "Bad YouTube" is called Liberatube and serves the purpose as a better way to access YouTube without all the Ads and Spyware from Google.

## How it works

In newer versions, Liberatube does not use any Google or YouTube API's, but uses the Invidious API to get all of the data from YouTube.
