## Do Not Send DMCA Takedown Requests to Liberatube

Liberatube does not host any video content. All videos accessed through Liberatube are streamed directly from YouTube. If a video is removed from YouTube, it becomes immediately unavailable on Liberatube.

Liberatube is a frontend, not a hosting platform. It does not mirror, store, or distribute any copyrighted material.

Liberatube may temporarily cache publicly available metadata (such as video titles, thumbnails, channel names, and durations) for performance and functionality purposes. No video or audio content is stored or mirrored on our servers. This caching does not constitute infringement and is compliant with UK law, including relevant intermediary protections under the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 and Section 28A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

We will not process or respond to takedown requests. Any DMCA notices directed at Liberatube will be ignored.

## Takedown Requests Must Be Submitted to YouTube

If you believe your copyrighted material appears on YouTube without authorization, you must file a complaint directly with YouTube, which is the actual content host.

Submit your takedown request using YouTubeâ€™s official form: [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622?hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622?hl=en)
