## Installing on a Hosting Provider

If you want to host Liberatube on a Hosting Provider, MySQL and PHP are typically present and you don't need to install anything. Now you can head over to [Installation](2.installation.md).

## Manual Install

### **Nginx or Apache**

> Preferably Nginx or Apache

Apache

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install apache2
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    ```

Nginx

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install nginx
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install nginx
    systemctl start nginx
    systemctl enable nginx
    ```

### **PHP**

You need to install PHP onto your Nginx or Apache.

For Nginx

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt install php-fpm
    systemctl start php-fpm
    systemctl enable php-fpm
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install php-fpm
    systemctl start php-fpm
    systemctl enable php-fpm
    ```

For Apache

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt install php libapache2-mod-php
    systemctl restart apache2
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install php php-mysql
    systemctl restart apache2
    ```

### **MySQL or any Equivalent Database**

Liberatube requires a robust database system to store and manage its data. MySQL is a popular choice, but you can opt for other databases like MariaDB or PostgreSQL based on your preferences. Install MySQL and its PHP extension for interaction:

For both Nginx and Apache

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt install mysql-server php-mysql
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install mariadb-server php-mysql
    ```

After installation, restart the MySQL service

```bash
systemctl restart mysql
```

With these components in place, Liberatube's infrastructure is taking shape, Now you can head over to the [Installation](2.installation.md).

### **Invidious**

Liberatube is entirely dependant on Invidious to fetch data from YouTube. You can configure the instances on the config file.
