# Installation

## Docker

Installing using the docker-compose file requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed, instructions can be found in [Prerequisites](1.prerequisites.md).

Clone the Git Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoldDominik893/liberatube.git
cd liberatube/
```

Run the docker-compose script

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify that Liberatube has been installed by going to `127.0.0.1:80`. You should also follow the [Post Install configuration](3.post-install.md) for extra options and settings.

!!! failure

    There is no docker-compose script yet, using these instructions won't work until I make one.

## Manual Install

Installing Manually requires all the [Prerequisites](1.prerequisites.md) to be installed before doing any of the following.

Clone the Git Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoldDominik893/liberatube.git
cd liberatube/
```

Move the contents of liberatube/ to /var/www/html (this may require root privileges)

```bash
mv * /var/www/html
```

Now Liberatube will be accessible at `127.0.0.1:80`, but it requires an SQL database to operate.

!!! info

    In the future there will be an SQL-less option in the config.
    This will mean you can't create an account and make playlists etc.

**MySQL setup**

The easiest way would be using a GUI which is phpMyAdmin and can be installed using:

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install phpmyadmin
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install phpmyadmin
    ```

Once you have installed phpMyAdmin you can access it at `127.0.0.1:80/phpmyadmin`, you may need to log in.
Using the phpMyAdmin web panel, create a database and import the table in database.sql.

Edit the config.php file in /var/www/html/config.php to have the correct database credentials.

```bash
nano /var/www/html/config.php
```

Edit these 4 lines

```php
$servername = "localhost"; // The IP / domain used to connect to your database
$username = "root";        // The database username
$password = "";            // The database password
$dbname = "users";         // The database name, by default, if you imported database.sql it is "users"
```

!!! success

    After doing all of that, Liberatube is considered to be installed and working although you should follow the [Post Install configuration](3.post-install.md) for extra options and settings.
